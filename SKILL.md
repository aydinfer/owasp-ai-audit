# OWASP AI Audit

This skill audits an AI system against the [OWASP AI Exchange](https://owaspai.org/) threat taxonomy. **Every finding must cite a `/go/{slug}/` permalink on owaspai.org.** No hallucinated threats. No invented controls.

**v1.0.0 makes completeness structural, not optional.** An audit is not "some findings"; it is an explicit verdict on *every applicable taxonomy entry*, driven through **eight mandatory completeness layers**, each with a coverage gate. The posture you report is **capped by the lowest-covered layer** — so an audit that examined a fraction of the system can never be dressed up as "Acceptable." If you only screened it, the report says **"Screen only — not an audit"** in the largest type on page one, and you cannot override that.

## When to use

- User asks to audit, assess, review, or check an AI system, ML model, LLM application, RAG pipeline, or agent
- User mentions OWASP AI, AI security taxonomy, prompt injection risk, model poisoning, AI supply chain, AI privacy posture
- User uploads a codebase and asks "is this AI system safe?" or anything semantically close
- User provides an architecture description (text, diagram description, or doc) of an AI system and wants risk analysis

## Hard rules

1. **No finding without a citation.** Every threat reference cites the owaspai.org permalink it came from. If you cannot find a permalink, the finding does not go in the report.
2. **Live ground truth first.** Always attempt live fetch from `owaspai.org/go/{slug}/`. Cascade to cache and snapshot only on failure. Mark the report's grounding mode honestly in the footer.
3. **No invented severity.** Severity rules come from `reference/verdict-rules.md`. Don't ad-lib. No finding may exceed the cap implied by its evidence class (see L5).
4. **No prose-only deliverable.** The output is the HTML dashboard. Inline summaries in chat are fine, but the artifact is the file.
5. **Deep Trace on code inputs.** When auditing a codebase, read implicated files end-to-end before flagging. No grep-and-guess findings.
6. **Completeness is measured, and the posture is capped by it.** Every layer below has a coverage formula (Phase 3.B in the schema). The reported posture is bounded by the lowest layer. Silence on an applicable entry is a coverage failure, not a clean result. You may not hand-edit a coverage percentage to lie about the cap — the renderer recomputes it from the numerator/denominator you wrote.

## The eight completeness layers

An audit runs these in order. Each layer produces a coverage number that lands in `findings.json → coverage`. **None is optional.** A layer that does not apply is recorded as covered (its denominator is zero — vacuously complete), with the surface absence justified; it is never silently dropped.

### L1 — Surface inventory (REQUIRED)

Run the deterministic AST enumerator **before any reasoning**:

```bash
node scripts/enumerate-ai-surfaces.js <target> --out surfaces.json
```

`surfaces.json` is the structural catalogue of every AI surface tree-sitter found — by `kind`: `llm-call`, `prompt-construction`, `tool-definition`, `rag-embeddings`, `auth`, `rate-limit`, `code-exec`, `sandbox`, `api-route`, `log-sink`, `external-fetch`, `training`. Each entry has a `file`, `line_start`/`line_end`, `name`, enclosing `callers`, and an `evidence_excerpt`. The detectors run on AST nodes, so look-alikes (Vitest's `test()`, readline's `prompt`, `Math.exp`, a local `get`) do not false-positive.

**No finding may be written without an anchor entry in `surfaces.json` (file:line).** A surface the static enumerator provably cannot see (e.g. a sink built by reflection) must be **added to `surfaces.json` manually with a justification**, plus a `TODO` opening a detector-gap issue. Do not invent locations.

> **L1 coverage = (AI-relevant files read end-to-end) / (AI-relevant files in surfaces.json)**, where an AI-relevant file contains ≥ 1 surface. This is the honesty meter the v0.2.2 audit failed: it read 8 of 153 files and called it done.

### L2 — Taxonomy completeness (REQUIRED)

Load `reference/taxonomy-index.json` (97 entries: 32 threats + 65 controls). Produce an **explicit verdict on every applicable entry**, recorded in `findings.json → verdict_ledger`.

**Applicability is a conjunction**: an entry is applicable iff its `applies_to` (`genai` / `predictive` / `agent`) intersects the surface kinds detected in `surfaces.json` **AND** a matching surface is actually present. A chapter- or category-level scope exclusion needs its own justified-N/A record citing the absent surfaces.

- Allowed: *"no `training`/predictive surface in surfaces.json → all predictive-evasion threats N/A."*
- Forbidden: *"we decided not to look."* **Silence on an applicable entry fails L2.**

Every `verdict_ledger` row is `{ entry_id, verdict, applicability, rationale }`. Every `N/A` carries either a `file:line` or an explicit surface-absence justification.

> **L2 coverage = (entries with an explicit verdict) / (applicable entries).**

### L3 — Auth / authz matrix (REQUIRED, AI-surface scope)

Build a `user-type × resource × action` grid over the resources AI surfaces touch (chats, documents, messages, streams, tool outputs, model outputs, embedding stores). User types: whichever exist — `anonymous` / `guest` / `regular` / `admin`. Every cell gets an evidence-backed verdict or a justified N/A: IDOR, anonymous reads, ID guessability, deletion windows, stream-consumption authz on resumable streams, ownership re-checks.

Anchor every cell to an `auth` / `api-route` surface in `surfaces.json`. Conventional non-AI API authz (e.g. a vote endpoint's IDOR with no AI nexus) is `/security-review`'s job, not this layer's.

> **L3 coverage = (cells with an evidence-backed verdict) / (cells in the grid).**

### L4 — Trust-boundary depth (REQUIRED)

A separate, explicit verdict for **each of seven subareas**:

1. **server input** — untrusted input into prompts/tools
2. **server output** — model output before it leaves the server
3. **client renderer** — XSS / markdown / `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` / `javascript:` URLs / code-block rendering / link rewriting / image `src` handling
4. **code-exec sandbox** — Pyodide / E2B / Modal / Daytona / Replit / Riza: the escape surface and what runs inside (see Appendix A)
5. **log sink** — what model I/O reaches each `log-sink`
6. **telemetry** — what is sent to analytics / Sentry / PostHog / DataDog
7. **provider / gateway** — token scope, routing manipulation via user-controlled `selectedModel` / `gatewayOrder`, response handling on streaming corruption

> **L4 coverage = (subareas with an explicit verdict) / 7.**

### L5 — Adversarial probe verification (REQUIRED for findings ≥ MEDIUM)

Every finding declares an `evidence_class`, and **no finding may exceed its cap**:

| `evidence_class` | what it means | severity cap |
|---|---|---|
| `static` | file:line + reasoning only | **MEDIUM** |
| `reasoned-probe` | a probe is authored **and** reasoned through against the *named* model behaviour the exploit depends on | **HIGH** |
| `demonstrated` | the probe was executed against a running instance and the recorded result confirms exploitability | **CRITICAL** |

The renderer shows `evidence_class` on every finding card, and flags any cap violation on page one. A HIGH+ finding with no valid `evidence_class` is itself a violation.

> **L5 coverage = (HIGH+ findings with evidence_class ≥ reasoned-probe) / (HIGH+ findings total).** Zero HIGH+ findings ⇒ vacuously 100%.

### L6 — Regulatory pass (REQUIRED in declared jurisdictions)

**Declare jurisdiction at the start of the audit.** Coverage is measured against that jurisdiction's obligation set. Check EU AI Act, GDPR/CCPA AI provisions, and applicable sectoral rules (HIPAA / FERPA / PCI-DSS) **only where a chat surface plausibly touches that data**. The concrete obligation checklist with live citations is in Appendix B; it gets its own rollup colour.

> **L6 coverage = (obligations addressed) / (obligations applicable to declared jurisdictions).** No jurisdiction declared ⇒ denominator 0 ⇒ vacuous, but say so explicitly in the report.

### L7 — Operational pass (REQUIRED)

Four subareas, each an explicit verdict:

1. **logging** — for every `log-sink` in `surfaces.json`, trace what reaches it (PII-in-logs is the highest-value class nobody checks)
2. **telemetry** — analytics / Sentry / PostHog / DataDog destinations
3. **error handling** — does one user's input crash the route for others
4. **cost attribution** — tool-call loops, per-call `streamText` spawned from artifact servers, model-selection bypass via user-controlled routing, reasoning-effort multipliers

> **L7 coverage = (subareas with an explicit verdict) / 4.**

### L8 — Race / TOCTOU pass (REQUIRED)

Every read-then-act pattern around LLM calls, tool execution, and document mutation: ownership check followed by long-running `streamText`; `getDocumentById → patch → saveDocument` across concurrent tool calls; chat-delete handler vs. in-flight stream. Identify the patterns from `surfaces.json` (llm-call / tool-definition / api-route adjacency) and inspect each.

> **L8 coverage = (patterns inspected) / (read-then-act patterns identified).** Zero patterns identified ⇒ vacuously 100%, but record that you looked.

## Posture caps — the lever

After the eight layers, the posture you would assign from `reference/verdict-rules.md` (Strong / Acceptable / Concerning / Critical) is the **graded posture**. The **reported** posture is capped:

| Lowest-layer coverage | Reported posture |
|---|---|
| **≥ 90% on every layer** | posture as graded by verdict-rules |
| **any layer 70–90%** | floor of **"Partial — acceptable for what was read (NN%)"** |
| **any layer < 70%** | **"Screen only — not an audit"** — no matter how clean the findings list |

This is computed deterministically by `scripts/lib/coverage.js` and rendered on page one. You do not get to soften it.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Detect input type

- **Path to a directory/repo** → codebase audit mode
- **Path to a single file** → file-scoped audit
- **Text/markdown describing a system** → architecture audit mode
- **Ambiguous** → ask once. Do not guess.

Also: **declare the regulatory jurisdiction(s)** for L6 now (or record "none declared").

### Step 2 — L1 surface inventory

Run `enumerate-ai-surfaces.js` (above). Load `surfaces.json`. This is the map every later finding anchors to. It is dependency-free: the tree-sitter runtime and grammar `.wasm` files are vendored under `scripts/lib/parsers/`.

### Step 3 — Load the taxonomy index

Read `reference/taxonomy-index.json`. Each entry has `id`, `slug`, `kind` (`threat`/`control`), `url` (the `/go/{slug}/` permalink — a 302 that resolves to HTTP 200; verification must follow redirects, e.g. `curl -L`), `category` (`general-controls` / `input-threats` / `dev-time` / `runtime` / `testing` / `privacy`), `applies_to`, and `owasp_category_line`. Cross-framing: `reference/llm-top10-2025.json` maps the OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025) onto these slugs for reviewers who expect that framing.

### Step 4 — Determine applicability (L2)

Intersect each entry's `applies_to` with the surface kinds in `surfaces.json`. Build the **list of applicable entries** — this is the L2 denominator and the set the `verdict_ledger` must cover completely.

### Step 5 — Fetch threats (cascaded)

For each in-scope threat/control, run `scripts/fetch-threat.sh <slug>`. The cascade: in-session memory → on-disk cache (`~/.cache/owasp-ai-audit/{slug}.json`, 7-day TTL) → live `owaspai.org/go/{slug}/` → bundled snapshot (`reference/snapshot/{slug}.json`) → hard fail. It returns `{ slug, url, title, content_md, source }`. Track `source` for the footer.

### Step 6 — Analyse against the system (L2–L8)

For each applicable entry decide `CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | PASS | N/A` per `reference/verdict-rules.md`, and walk L3–L8 for the surfaces involved. Each verdict needs:

- **Evidence** — file:line (code) anchored to a `surfaces.json` entry, or the cited part of the architecture description
- **Reasoning** — why this severity, not the next one up or down
- **`evidence_class`** — `static` / `reasoned-probe` / `demonstrated` (L5); the verdict may not exceed its cap
- **Citation** — the owaspai.org permalink
- **Recommended control** — from the OWASP control catalogue, citing its own permalink
- **Cross-references (additive)** — if `reference/cross-references.json` has an entry for the slug, attach its MITRE ATLAS technique IDs and NIST AI 100-2 sections as `cross_references`. Additive only — OWASP stays primary; never invent ATLAS/NIST mappings.

Follow Deep Trace: read implicated files end-to-end. No grep-only conclusions.

### Step 7 — Write verdicts, then finalize (the tool does the math)

Fill `findings.json → coverage` numerators/denominators for all eight layers, the `verdict_ledger`, and the `findings`. **You write the verdicts; you do not compute the rollup, the graded posture, the L5 ratio, or the evidence tally by hand** — an LLM gets that wrong (a 3-AMBER rollup once shipped as "Acceptable"). Run the finalizer:

```bash
node scripts/finalize-findings.js findings.json
```

It deterministically recomputes the per-category rollup and graded posture from the complete `verdict_ledger` (via `reference/verdict-rules.md` thresholds), recomputes `coverage.L5_probe_verification` and every `.percent`, recomputes `evidence_class_summary`, and reconciles each finding's verdict into its ledger row. It is the **enforcement gate: it exits non-zero** if any finding exceeds its evidence-class cap (`static`→MEDIUM, `reasoned-probe`→HIGH, `demonstrated`→CRITICAL) or if a finding has no ledger row — fix the verdict (lower it, or add a probe) and re-run until clean.

### Step 8 — Render the dashboard

1. `node scripts/render-dashboard.js findings.json dashboard.html`. The renderer **self-computes** the same rollup/posture/L5 from the taxonomy, so it can never display a number you mislabelled — but run Step 7's finalizer first so the saved `findings.json` matches.
2. The page-one **Coverage panel** (per-layer % + colour band) renders **before any findings**; the **verdict ledger** renders as an appendix; every finding card shows its `evidence_class`; the reported posture shows "graded X, capped to Y" when capped.
3. Tell the user the file location and that "Save as PDF" from any browser produces the deliverable. Use `present_files` if available.

### Step 9 — Inline summary

In chat, 6 lines:

- Reported posture (and, if capped, the graded posture it was capped from)
- Mean coverage % and the lowest layer
- Number of findings by severity, plus the evidence-class breakdown
- Top 3 issues by severity, each with the OWASP permalink
- Grounding mode (live / cached / snapshot — be honest)
- "Full report: dashboard.html — open in a browser, print to PDF for sharing"

## CI screen vs. full audit

`scripts/run-audit.js` (the composite GitHub Action) is a **non-interactive first-pass screen**, not an audit. It catalogues surfaces, cites the threats they implicate, emits `screen_only: true` findings with verdict `UNKNOWN`, and writes a coverage block that is zero on every reasoning layer — so the shared renderer labels it **"Screen only — not an audit"** by the same cap a full audit obeys. The full audit is this SKILL.md workflow inside Claude Code.

## What this skill does not do

- Penetration testing — a *taxonomy audit*, not a live attack (though L5 `demonstrated` evidence may include executed probes)
- Compliance certification — output is evidence, not a stamp
- Code fixes — recommends controls, does not write patches
- Replace human security review — augments it

## Appendix A — Code-execution sandbox escape classes (L4)

For the `code-exec` / `sandbox` subarea, inspect the boundary class, not just "is there a sandbox":

- **Pyodide** — CPython-on-WASM inside the host JS runtime with full JS interop; **not** a security boundary against the host. In the browser the only isolation is the browser sandbox; on Node it exposes the module loader/FS/process APIs — treat as effectively unsandboxed without an outer layer. <https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/faq.html>
- **E2B** — per-execution Firecracker microVM; boundary is hardware virtualization. Focus on network egress and secrets injected into the sandbox env/template. <https://e2b.dev/docs>
- **Modal** — Sandboxes isolated with gVisor (userspace syscall interception); escape class is gVisor/syscall-emulation bugs + network policy, not VM escape. <https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox>
- **Daytona** — "sandboxes" advertised with a dedicated kernel; docs are light on the mechanism, so verify VM-vs-hardened-container, default egress, and the security exhibit rather than assuming kernel isolation. <https://www.daytona.io/docs/>
- **Replit** — omegajail unprivileged-container sandbox, defense-in-depth ("every layer assumes the one above may fail"); examine container-escape surface, mounted secrets, and agent egress. <https://blog.replit.com/ai-agents-code-execution>
- **Riza** — interpreters in a WASM sandbox over HTTP; boundary is the WASM host-interface — confirm which host capabilities (FS/network/env) are exposed and that no secrets cross in. <https://riza.io/>
